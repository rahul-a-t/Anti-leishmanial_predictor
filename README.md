# Project Title: From Chemical Structures to Anti-Leishmanial Activity: A Machine Learning Approach

## Introduction
In this project, binary classifier machine learning models were developed to predict whether a given molecule has the potential of being an anti-leishmanial against *Leishmania donovani*.

## Methodology
- **Features Used**: 
  - Molecular descriptors
  - Molecular fingerprints (ECFP and FCFP)
- **Data**: 
  - Trained on 5705 drug-like compounds
- **Models Developed**: 
  - Extreme Gradient Boost (XGB)
  - Random Forest (RF)

## Results
- XGB and RF models outperformed others in terms of accuracy.
- Achieved over 79% accuracy in both cross-validation and test sets with a smaller subset of descriptors.

## Conclusion
A web tool was developed utilizing these models.

## Declaration
I hereby declare that the project entitled, “From Chemical Structures to Anti Leishmanial Activity: A Machine Learning Approach,” submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements of the degree of Master of Science in Bioinformatics, has been carried out by me at Bioinformatics Centre, Savitribai Phule Pune University.
